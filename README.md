For any 4-digit number with at least 2 different digits:

1. if arranged in descending and ascending order,
2. subtracted the smaller number from the bigger one,
3. Kaprekar's constant (6174) will be returned
4. (many iterations may be needed).

## Objective

    1. I like mathematics, it's just for fun lol
    2. It's been practical to learn how to make GUI's
